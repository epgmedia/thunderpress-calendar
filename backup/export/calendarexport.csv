First question to ask yourself is, ""Are you or anyone you know affected by cancer?"" I’m sure that the majority of you answered yes. You probably know then how hard it can be on the families and what a financial burden this can be. “Ride For Life” was started by a friend and fellow rider, Mr. Dan Ertz, as a way to raise funds for the Inland Northwest “Cancer Patient Care” organization.  “Cancer Patient Care” is a non-profit organization that provides assistance to families in need that are dealing with cancer. They help with things such as utility bill assistance, or gasoline for your car to get to a chemotherapy treatment or as simple as just putting food on the table. Sometimes the person affected may be the bread winner in the family and can’t work or because their child or spouse may be the patient and they have been forced to take time off from their jobs. Medical Insurance does not cover things like this and now they just don’t have the means to pay for these things. These are our friends, our neighbors and in some cases our own families. Let's all join together to help them. Remember, all of the money raised by this event stays local in the Inland Northwest.The bottom line is Cancer Patient Care is a great non-prophet organization helping local families suffering with cancer. They can not do it without the generous contributions of folk like you.Please join us and ""RIDE FOR LIFE.""&nbsp;","","26433 West Trent Road","","Hauser","ID","83854","","scott.rdhse@gmail.com","http://www.rideforlifeidaho.net","","","","","","","This is great fun filled event starting with a fabulous ride around Lake Couer D Alene, music, food, raffles and 2 different auctions.

Frequented by moto lovers as well as celebrities and nice people of all types, the Rock Store is an amazing place to get away from the city without going too far.  Located along famous Mulholland Highway halfway between Malibu and Calabasas, it's the perfect place to come by bike or by car for breakfast or lunch and a drink on Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays.","","30354 Mulholland Highway","","Cornell","CA","91301","","info@corridorcomms.com","","","","","360","","","Imagine this: Tons of motorcyclists, bikers and community members posing for professional photos with their favorite pooches and kitties at the world famous Rock Store!

Here are just a few: Harley-Davidson 110th, Chevrolet, and Corvette, Ford, Buick, Chrysler and The Wright Brothers just to name a few. The plan is to bring together the local dealers and any other vendors that would complement each other.Since this is a family event we also have a local game party truck for the kids, Big Foot truck rides, the Bat Mobile and the General Lee Car from the Dukes of Hazard ’60s TV show, two hot air balloons and several other things for the young and old generations. To help support our community we have asked the local fire departments if they want to prepare their specialties and use it as fund raisers. We will have a 40 X 100 food pavilion with chairs and tables. There will also be other food vendors that will include ice cream, funnel cakes, water, soda etc.In conjunction with the FAA which is in our area we were able to have as a guest at our event to celebrate 110 years of the Wright Brothers first fight, NASA astronaut Dr. Terry Hart, who was a mission specialist on STS-41C Challenger (April 6–13, 1984), he will be giving a presentation on his journey.To finish off the evening we will have a band and a grand finale of fire works provided by a local company for entertainment.","","4501 Black Horse Pike","","Mayslanding","NJ","","","ben@acharley.com","http://www.celebrationofheritage.com","","","","360","","","Family friendly event with a local game party truck for the kids, Big Foot truck rides, the Bat Mobile and the General Lee Car from the Dukes of Hazard ’60s TV show, two hot air balloons and several other things for the young and old generations, food vendors.

It is a pleasant half-mile walk from the Medical CenterDavid's House is the dream of a young boy named David Cyr, who passed away from leukemia in 1984 at the age of five. For three and a half years, David was treated at Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in Hanover, NH. Visiting David during his hospitalizations was easy for his parents who lived only 20 minutes away. But during this time his family met others who didn't have that option; instead they slept in their cars, in the waiting room, or in a chair at bedside to be close to their child. When David's doctor told the Cyrs that David had just months to live, his father, Dick, asked the doctor, ""Why isn't there a place for families like ours to stay?"" The doctor told him there had been talk about a house in this area, but nothing had ever come of it. Dick replied, ""We're going to build a place, and we're going to call it David's House."" One week after David passed away, his parents and their friends began raising funds for David's House. The first money was David's own: $300.78 in birthday money and his dad's spare change that David had stashed away throughout the house. Whenever Dick asked him what he was saving for, David always replied, ""For a special reason, Dad."" That special reason has now served over 12,000 families from around the world!","","Route 5","","Westminster","VT","","","gamecock87@comcast.net","http://www.davids-house.org ","","","","360","","","There will be a catered lunch provided at the end site at David’s House in Lebanon, New Hampshire.

Her diagnosis has affected our family deeply. Our pain and grief at the loss of her freedom as a child has inspired us to raise awareness about a growing epidemic affecting young children all over. In order to help our family and other families cope, and to have a place to reach out for support we have decided to become proactive with our daughter's disease. Young children diagnosed with this disease are subjected to as many as 10 finger pokes a day and possibly up to as many as 8 insulin shots a day to maintain their health. Diabetes is not just a strain on these children but also on their siblings, parents, and caregivers.""But I have Diabetes"" is a non-profit organization: Our goal is to grow by creating a charitable giving campaign to promote diabetes awareness. Support newly affected families by providing them with information about their new diagnosis and with the support of other families that have been affected by this disease for many years. Provide children and their families with the supplies, and support they wouldn't normally be able to afford. Creating support groups for children and their families to share experiences trials and tribulations that they have had while they fight this disease.We are hosting our 2nd annual motorcycle run July 27th 2013, which will include the following: a barbecue, raffle drawings, education &amp; Information booth, live music and much more. Our goal for this event is to raise money to help children and families with Diabetes. Part of the proceeds will also be going to JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) jdrfbayarea.org. JDRF is the leader of the type 1 diabetes (T1D) community—unifying global efforts to cure, treat, and prevent T1D.","","3893 N Willow Rd","","Bethel Island","CA","94511","","aaron@butihavediabetes.org","http://www.butihavediabetes.org","","https://www.facebook.com/but.i.have.diabetes","","360","","","Barbecue, raffle drawings, education & Information booth, live music and much more.
